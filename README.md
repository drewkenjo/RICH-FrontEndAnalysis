## Preliminary studies of Front End electronics with RICH Black Box
#####Data Runs:
* OD54+diffuser runs, gain: [32-224, step 32], threshold: [250-650, step 50], 1000 V, 2ASIC and 3ASIC
  * - [x] run0 - low stat, 10 repetitions x 100k events
  * - [x] run1 - med stat, 100 repetitions x 100k events

* low light intensity, achieved by "wrong" laser position, 1000 V, 3ASIC
  * - [x] run2 - high stat, 1000 repetitions x 100k events, gain: 32 and 64, threshold: [250-650, step 50]
  * - [x] run2 - high stat (interrupted mid way due to hard disk space), 524 repetitions x 100k events, gain: 128, threshold: 250

* LED runs, gain: [32-224, step 32], threshold: [250-650, step 50], 1000 V
  * - [x] led0 - low stat, 10 repetitions x 100k events, 2ASIC and 3ASIC
  * - [x] led1 - med stat, 100 repetitions x 100k events, 2ASIC

* Pedestal runs, no light source, threshold [250-650, step 50], 3ASIC
  * - [x] ped2 - high stat, 1000 reps x 100k events, gain: 64, 1000 V
  * - [ ] ped0 - low stat, 10 reps x 100k events, gain: [32-224, step 32], 1000,1050,1075,1100 V
